## Project Overview

This is a static website for "VisionCore Dynamics", a company specializing in computer vision and machine learning solutions for industrial applications. The website is designed to be a visually appealing landing page, showcasing the company's services and providing contact information.

The site is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It features a modern, responsive design with animations and a language switcher for Romanian and English.

## Key Files

*   `index.html`: The main landing page of the website. It contains the hero section, an overview of the company's services, and links to more detailed pages.
*   `app1.html`, `app2.html`, `app3.html`: These pages provide more detailed information about the specific services offered: Automated Inspection, Predictive Maintenance, and Logistics Optimization.
*   `style.css`: This file contains all the styles for the website, including the layout, colors, fonts, and animations.
*   `script.js`: This file contains the JavaScript code for the website's interactive features, such as the particle animations, language switcher, and parallax effects.
*   `images/`: This directory contains the images used on the website.

## Development

This is a static website, so there is no build process. To "run" the project, simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

### Conventions

*   The website uses a language switcher to toggle between Romanian and English. The translations are stored in the `script.js` file.
*   The styling is done with CSS, and it includes responsive design for different screen sizes.
*   The JavaScript code is used for animations and interactive elements.
